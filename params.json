We're using the WordCamp Base Redux theme to get started. All changes should be made in the /sass/ directory, which will be output to custom.css, and then copied to Jetpack’s Custom CSS on the live site when we’re ready to launch.\r\n\r\n... I'll finish the readme later.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
